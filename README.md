# 📐 Number Pyramid Generator

This Python program lets you create a **number pyramid** based on user input! 📊 When you provide a number (`x`), the program generates a pyramid pattern where
each row contains increasing numbers, starting from 1 up to the row number. The pyramid continues up to your specified number.

## 📋 Example Output

For example, if you enter `x = 5`, the output will be:
Enter x: 5 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5
