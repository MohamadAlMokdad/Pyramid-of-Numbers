# 📐 Number Pyramid Generator

This Python program lets you create a **number pyramid** based on user input! 📊 When you provide a number (`x`), the program generates a pyramid pattern where
each row contains increasing numbers, starting from 1 up to the row number. The pyramid continues up to your specified number.
